# Sapphire

**Small in Size, Infinite in Value; Your All-in-One Solution**

Sapphire is an innovative application that provides a multitude of small yet incredibly useful features that are too valuable to overlook but too minor to warrant separate applications. With over 110 unique features and new ones added daily, Sapphire is designed to enhance your experience across various platforms.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The app is not finished. I planned 1000 functions but deliviered only ~160. I will add the rest this summer (will not push to the main branch because of YH4F submission deadline on 30 June). I planned online sync but that is also not implemented because of security and privacy concerns. I am really sorry for all the missing features. Last school year was very hard for me and I couldn't find much time before June. I was basically studying all day for the "Egzamin Ã“smoklasisty" which is a very important exam in Poland and for other contests.

> [!WARNING]  
> Note that the browser version was tested only on Windows and Linux in Chrome and Firefox with uBlock Origin both enabled and disabled. If you can please install local version because it supports more features and is better tested.

## User Guide
The first thing you have to do is installation of the app. If you are using Windows or Linux with Chrome or Firefox you can use the web version at [sapphire.spageektti.cc](http://sapphire.spageektti.cc). Note that it has limited functionality, it doesn't work offline unless you save the website and some features aren't working because of browser limitations. We have fully-featured applications for Linux and Android. Other platforms will be supported, but I don't have devices to test them yet. If you want to install our app navigate to the [releases page](https://github.com/spageektti/sapphire/releases) and select the right file.
