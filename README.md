> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The app is not finished. I planned 1000 functions but deliviered only ~160. I will add the rest this summer (will not push to the main branch because of YH4F submission deadline on 30 June). I planned online sync but that is also not implemented because of security and privacy concerns. I am really sorry for all the missing features. Last school year was very hard for me and I couldn't find much time before June. I was basically studying all day for the "Egzamin Ã“smoklasisty" which is a very important exam in Poland and for other contests. After all I am still only 15yo...

> Note that the browser version was tested only on Windows and GNU/Linux in Chrome and Firefox with uBlock Origin both enabled and disabled. If you can please install local version because it supports more features and is better tested.

### For people that will be reviewing my project for Youth Hacking 4 Freedom contest
I want to thank you for organizing this amazing contest. Even if I don't win anything I still learned a lot over the last 6 months. I spent around 150 hours coding this app (not including other things like designing or thinking about new features) - at least that is what hackatime says. I also kindly ask you to not only judge my project by what is already done, but how the app can grow in the future.

## Features
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works seamlessly on Android, Windows, GNU/Linux, and in your browser. Mac and iOS binaries planned.
- **Extensive Feature Set:** Over 160 unique features, with new additions weekly.
- **Calculators & Device Information:** Use our calculators and get detailed information about your device or browser.
- **Customizable Experience:** Each feature comes with its own settings and descriptions, allowing you to tailor your experience.
- **Search Functionality:** Easily search for features to find exactly what you need.
- **Personalized Home Screen:** Customize your home screen to suit your preferences.
- **Language & Theme Options:** Change your language and theme to enhance usability.
- **Lightweight:** All of this functionality is packed into an app that is under 50MB.
- **Open Source:** Use, study, share, and improve the app as it is fully free (as in freedom) and open source software. Check the developer guide below to get easy step-by-step guide on how to contribute to the project.
- **Offline Support** Access essential features and tools without an internet connection. Users can utilize calculators, view device information, and customize settings even when offline, ensuring a seamless experience regardless of connectivity.
- **Independence from External APIs:** The app operates independently of any company or third-party APIs, ensuring that all processing is done locally on your device. This guarantees enhanced privacy and performance, with the exception of two NASA-related features, which require internet access for data retrieval.
- **Practical Relevance:** Designed with real-world applications in mind. Whether you need quick calculations, device insights, or customizable tools, every feature is crafted to provide practical solutions that fit seamlessly into your everyday life.

## Usage

Please start by watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxzWOJS6zDo).

When you launch the app, you will see the home screen. By default, all available functions are grouped into categories. To launch a function, simply click on it. They are designed to be user-friendly, so detailed explanations are not necessary.

### App Bar
On the App Bar (top of the screen), there are two buttons:
- **Information Button (i):** Pressing this button provides basic information about the function, including its name, description, and author. Currently, I am the author of all functions, but as the app is FOSS (Free and Open Source Software), others can add their own features or demos of their apps to Sapphire.
- **Settings Button:** Press this button to customize the function. 

### Example Customization
For instance, you can change the maximum number of digits accepted by the GCD function. If the animation below does not display, please click [this link](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25c5c70d-25db-484f-a467-2bead113ab6e).

### Customizing the Home Screen
You can also customize your home screen:
1. Click the pencil icon in the bottom right corner.
2. Change the order of functions, delete functions, or remove entire categories.
3. To add a new category, scroll to the bottom of the home screen.
4. To add a feature to the home screen, switch to the search page and click the **+** next to a feature, or click on the feature name to test it first.

### Access Settings
Access the settings page to:
- Change the language and theme.
- Export and import backups.
- Reset everything to default.

## Developer Guide

### Setup
To clone the Sapphire repository and run the Flutter app, follow these steps:

1. **Install Flutter:** If you haven't already, install Flutter on your machine. You can find installation instructions at the [Flutter official website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
> [!WARNING]  
> Please use Flutter version `3.27.0`. The latest version doesn't work because of used libraries.


2. **Clone the Repository:**
   Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/spageektti/sapphire.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd sapphire
   ```

4. **Get Dependencies:**
   Run the following command to get the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

5. **Run the Application:**
   You can run the application on an emulator or a physical device using:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Adding a New Feature

New features are more than welcome! To ensure a smooth integration, please follow the steps below:

1. **Use the Template**  
   There is a ready-to-use template for a new function. Copy the file located at:
   ```
   lib/functions/template.dart
   ```
   Place it in one of the subfolders of `lib/functions`. For example:
   - If your function is related to math, place it in:
     ```
     lib/functions/math
     ```
   - If it is Android-specific, use:
     ```
     lib/functions/android
     ```
   You can also create new subdirectories as needed.

2. **Add Translation Strings**  
   After coding your feature, add all the translation strings to:
   ```
   assets/translations/en-US.json
   ```
   You can check other pages for examples of how to implement this.

3. **Update Function List**  
   Fill in the `FunctionItem` in the `lib/function_list.dart` file. Note that the name should match the one you used in the translation strings.

4. **Submit Your Changes**  
   Now you can add your function to `default_home_list.dart` and submit a Pull Request (PR)!

If you encounter any issues with these steps, feel free to contact me or open an issue!
